        <h1>The Joke Tax Chronicles</h1>
        <p>
          Once upon a time, in a far-off land, there was a very lazy king who spent all day lounging
          on his throne. One day, his advisors came to him with a problem: the kingdom was running out
          of money.
        </p>
        <h2>The King&#x27;s Plan</h2>
        <p>
          The king thought long and hard, and finally came up with<!-- -->
          <a href="#">a brilliant plan</a>: he would tax the jokes in the kingdom.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          “After all,” he said, “everyone enjoys a good joke, so it&#x27;s only fair that they should
          pay for the privilege.”
        </blockquote>
        <h3>The Joke Tax</h3>
        <p>
          The king&#x27;s subjects were not amused. They grumbled and complained, but the king was
          firm:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>1st level of puns: 5 gold coins</li>
          <li>2nd level of jokes: 10 gold coins</li>
          <li>3rd level of one-liners : 20 gold coins</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          As a result, people stopped telling jokes, and the kingdom fell into a gloom. But there was
          one person who refused to let the king&#x27;s foolishness get him down: a court jester named
          Jokester.
        </p>
        <h3>Jokester&#x27;s Revolt</h3>
        <p>
          Jokester began sneaking into the castle in the middle of the night and leaving jokes all
          over the place: under the king&#x27;s pillow, in his soup, even in the royal toilet. The
          king was furious, but he couldn&#x27;t seem to stop Jokester.
        </p>
        <p>
          And then, one day, the people of the kingdom discovered that the jokes left by Jokester were
          so funny that they couldn&#x27;t help but laugh. And once they started laughing, they
          couldn&#x27;t stop.
        </p>
        <h3>The People&#x27;s Rebellion</h3>
        <p>
          The people of the kingdom, feeling uplifted by the laughter, started to tell jokes and puns
          again, and soon the entire kingdom was in on the joke.
        </p>
        <div>
          <table>
            <thead>
              <tr>
                <th>King&#x27;s Treasury</th>
                <th>People&#x27;s happiness</th>
              </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
              <tr>
                <td>Empty</td>
                <td>Overflowing</td>
              </tr>
              <tr class="m-0 border-t p-0 even:bg-zinc-100">
                <td>Modest</td>
                <td>Satisfied</td>
              </tr>
              <tr class="m-0 border-t p-0 even:bg-zinc-100">
                <td>Full</td>
                <td>Ecstatic</td>
              </tr>
            </tbody>
          </table>
        </div>
        <p>
          The king, seeing how much happier his subjects were, realized the error of his ways and
          repealed the joke tax. Jokester was declared a hero, and the kingdom lived happily ever
          after.
        </p>
        <p>
          The moral of the story is: never underestimate the power of a good laugh and always be
          careful of bad ideas.
